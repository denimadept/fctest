Fog Creek test program
Sort the characters in the following string:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_

by the number of times the character appears in the following text (descending):
[elided]

Now take the sorted string, and drop all the characters after (and including) the _. The remaining word is the answer.

I'm making a few assumptions here.  Characters are one byte.  They're all effectively ASCII.
All characters are either within the range specified above, or we drop them on the floor quietly.
